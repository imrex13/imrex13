### 🏆 Noteworthy Work

- 🧭 **Camp View (RexinTech – My Startup)**  
  Built and led as part of my registered startup **RexinTech**, this 3D Campus Navigation System uses GeoJSON and AI pathfinding to deliver real-time routing on an interactive map. Secured seed funding and tested in live campus environments.

- 🏛️ **Singapore National Museum Project**  
  Developed the backend system for an internal photo request platform used by museum staff and external researchers.

- 🤖 **Offline AI Assistant**  
  A fully offline RAG-powered personal assistant with file upload, vector indexing, and custom file-based memory — built for privacy-first LLM use cases.

- 🎓 **GASC Sync**  
  Role-based college management system with dashboards for admin, staff, and students — includes circulars, bonafide approval, and searchable public forums.


- ✋ **Touchless – Hand Gesture Control System**  
  Virtual interface using MediaPipe + OpenCV for controlling the mouse, scrolling, volume, and drawing via hand gestures. Modular and mode-switchable.

  
- 🔥 **Fire Vision (ForgeofCreations - Startup)**  
Contributed to a low-light fire detection system that uses real-time camera frames for safety which primarly focuses on installing it in existing cameras. Assisted in backend integration and deployment planning for device streaming.
